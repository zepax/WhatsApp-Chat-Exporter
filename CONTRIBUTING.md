# Contributing Guidelines

*Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!*

> **This guide serves to set clear expectations for everyone involved with the project so that we can improve it together while also creating a welcoming space for everyone to participate. Following these guidelines will help ensure a positive experience for contributors and maintainers.**

<sub> Maintainer's note: I aim to keep things simple and flexible, without imposing too many restrictions, while still ensuring itâ€™s useful for the project. </sub>

## :book: Code of Conduct

There isn't an official code of conduct at the moment, and we hope it won't be necessary. The rule is simple: be reasonable and treat others with respect!

## :bulb: Asking Questions

While there is no formal support from the maintainer, they are happy to help if you provide enough information. However, please note:

If you feel the questions or difficulties you're encountering aren't related to the software itself, please [open a discussion thread](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter/discussions/new/choose). Do not open an issue just to ask a question. While asking questions in the project issues is not strictly prohibited, any issues that don't qualify as genuine problems will be converted into discussion threads.

Hopefully, the community will be able to offer assistance as well. You can check out the article [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) on StackOverflow to learn how to craft questions that encourage more people to respond.

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### :lock: Reporting Security Issues

Please report any vulnerability to [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter/security/advisories/new). **Do not** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### :beetle: Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue or request has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too/I want this feature too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests. 

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The issue templates request all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable). This will assist the maintainer in efficiently triaging your issues and isolating the problems.

- For feature requests, be specific about the proposed outcome and how it fits with the existing features. If possible, include implementation details.

Note that feature requests may be out of scope for the project, and if accepted, we cannot commit to a specific timeline for implementation.

## :repeat: Submitting Pull Requests

- **Smaller is better.** Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. **Do not** refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to **submit many small pull requests** rather than a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether. 

- **Coordinate bigger changes.** For large and non-trivial changes, open an issue to discuss a strategy with the maintainers. Otherwise, you risk doing a lot of work for nothing!

- **Follow PEP8.** Python code should follow PEP8 formatting and styling guidelines. Consider using automated tools like [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) or [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) to ensure your code adheres to these standards.

- **[Resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)** that occur.

- Use spaces, not tabs.
